*lignet* is a project to train neural nets that can reproduce the results of my ODE-based kinetic model for lignin pyrolysis, *ligpy* [(available here)](https://github.com/houghb/ligpy).  Solving the full system of ODEs in *ligpy* is too computationally expensive for use in simulations of pyrolyzing particles, however, by training neural nets to predict desired *ligpy* outputs  we can achieve a XX% reduction in computational cost.
